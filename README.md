# Creating-your-own-basic-ATS-with-Excel

Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are the cornerstone of recruitment in modern HR departments, as they easily provide an overview of what stage the candidate is in during the recruitment process, something especially important as recruiters tend to create pipelines of multiple concurrent individuals. 

However, most companies need to rely on external pieces of software to use as ATS, that are costly and tend to suck up ludicrous and often indispensable amounts of money that businesses sometimes cannot afford, like in the case of a start-up with restricted starting capital or a smaller business with other investment priorities. 

Thankfully, Microsoft Excel, a versatile, albeit subscription-based, tool can act as a useful alternative, as it offers database and data analysis capabilties, similiar to other modern ATS in a fraction of the price.
